I\\'m in a hurry.\" - Indian English (Classified as 3) because \"Side, please\" is very common phrase used in Indian to ask the general public to move out the way in a polite manner.

            "Singaporean: Eh, the weather outside quite good for jalan-jalan, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: \"Eh\" is commonly used in Singaporean English (or Singlish) for calling attention. \"Quite good\" is a phrase often used by Singaporean to signify something is not just good, but quite satisfactory. \"Jalan-jalan\" is a Malay term used in Singlish meaning to \"go for a walk\". The word \"right\" at the end of the sentence is used as a question tag, which is commonly used by Singaporeans.\n",
            "2 I'll meet you down at the pub later for a pint.\n",
            "Singaporean: Later on I'll see you at the pub for a beer, okay? \n",
            "\n",
            "Singaporean English, often referred to colloquially as 'Singlish', is famed for its unique phrases and sentence structure. In this translation, \"I'll meet you down\" is made simpler to \"I'll see you\", as direct translations are more commonly used in Singlish. \"For a pint\" is translated to \"for a beer\" because 'a pint' is not as commonly used in Singaporean English. The term 'okay' is added at the end, mirroring the trend of ending statements with question tags in informal Singlish.\n",
            "3 We're just having a bit of craic at the party.\n",
            "Australian: We're just having a bit of fun at the shindig. \n",
            "\n",
            "This might be how an Australian might phrase it. \"Craic\" is a term commonly in Ireland and the United Kingdom, much less frequently in Australian English. Instead, they might use \"fun\". Additionally, \"party\" could be replaced with a more colloquial term like \"shindig\".\n",
            "4 I'm feeling a bit peckish; could you pass the Tayto crisps?\n",
            "Australian: I'm feeling a bit hungry; could you pass the chips, mate? \n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In Australian English, \"peckish\" can be replaced with \"hungry\" for better understanding. \"Mate\" is commonly used in Australia as a form of address. In place of Ireland's \"Tayto crisps,\" Australians would typically say \"chips.\"\n",
            "5 Would you be after stopping at the shop for some milk?\n",
            "Indian: Can you pop by the store for some milk, buddy?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: Indian English often includes phrases like 'pop by' for 'stop at', and 'store' for 'shop'. Additionally, terms of endearment such as 'buddy' or 'friend' are commonly used.\n",
            "6 That film was brilliant, so it was.\n",
            "Indian: Translated Sentence: That picture was first-rate, isn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: The word 'film' is often replaced with 'picture' in Indian English. 'So it was' could be replaced with 'isn't it' as a way to seek affirmation in a typical Indian manner. 'Brilliant' is directly translated to 'first-rate' to maintain the positive appreciation of the subject.\n",
            "7 I’ve a notion to bake some soda bread this afternoon, would you like some?\n",
            "British: I've a mind to bake some soda bread this afternoon, fancy some?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In British English, the phrases \"I’ve a notion to\" and \"I tried to\" is often swapped for \"I've a mind to\". \"would you like some\" could be changed to the more colloquial \"fancy some\" which is commonly heard in everyday British English.\n",
            "8 It's a soft day, thank God, just a light drizzle.\n",
            "British: It's a mild day, thank God, just a light drizzle. \n",
            "\n",
            "In British English, especially among older generations, 'soft' in relation to weather often refers to gentle rain or drizzle. However, its usage is more common in Ireland than in the UK and could be regionally misunderstood. Therefore, the term 'mild' is adopted which is universally understood among British English speakers to mean temperate or not severe. The rest of the sentence remains the same as it is already in a form that would be understood by speakers of British English.\n",
            "9 I'm just popping around the corner to buy some biltong.\n",
            "Singaporean: I'm just going nearby only to buy some biltong lah.\n",
            "\n",
            "The sentence is translated to Singaporean English, commonly known as Singlish, a vernacular form of English spoken in Singapore. The addition of the word \"lah\" at the end of sentences is a common feature in Singlish and is used to emphasize a point or soften requests or imperatives. Singlish also often omits the use of prepositions and auxiliary verbs for simplicity and speed in everyday communication.\n",
            "10 This new project is quite lekker, isn’t it?\n",
            "Singaporean: This new project quite shiok one, right?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: \n",
            "In Singaporean English, or Singlish as it's colloquially known, the term \"shiok\" is used to express great pleasure or satisfaction. It's a term borrowed from Malay and is quite versatile. Here it's used to express the satisfaction about the new project, mirroring the meaning of \"lekker\" in the original sentence (a South African term for something enjoyable). The phrase \"one, right?\" is a casual, colloquial way to turn the statement into a question.\n",
            "11 I reckon we should braai this weekend if the weather's good.\n",
            "Australian: Mate, reckon we should fire up the barbie this weekend if the weather's good, yeah?\n",
            "\n",
            "The reasoning behind this Australian translation is because Australians commonly refer to their friends as 'mate'. They use 'reckon' instead of 'think', 'barbie' as an abbreviation for 'barbecue', and they often end their sentences with 'yeah' for confirmation. Furthermore, 'braai' is a term used in South Africa for a barbecue, so it's replaced with the Australian equivalent.\n",
            "12 I'll come visit you now-now, just finishing up some work.\n",
            "Australian: I'll pop by directly, just wrapping up some work. \n",
            "\n",
            "In Australian English, phrases such as 'come visit' may be replaced by more informal terms like 'pop by'. 'Now-now' is not typically used in Australian English, and instead direct phrases like 'directly' or 'in a bit' can be used. It's also common in Australian English to use 'work' instead of 'some work'.\n",
            "13 That movie was too good, hey?\n",
            "Indian: That movie was first rate, isn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: Indian English often uses British English terms, such as 'first rate'. Also, it is common to use 'isn't it' at the end of sentences as a tag question. This is a feature unique to Indian English.\n",
            "14 I was thinking of going to the beach, just now, if the weather holds up.\n",
            "Indian: I was planning to head to the seashore just now, only if the weather stays good yaar.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Yaar' is an informal term used in Indian English generally among friends, similar to 'pal' or 'mate'. 'Seashore' is a more commonly used term in Indian English over 'beach'.\n",
            "\n",
            "15 You're going to the game, not so?\n",
            "British: You're going to the match, aren't you?\n",
            "\n",
            "In British English, \"game\" referring to a sporting event is commonly called a \"match\". \"Not so?\" is not typically used in British English and has been replaced with the more colloquially used formal question tag \"aren't you?\"\n",
            "16 I’ll fix this now-now, won’t take more than a minute.\n",
            "British: I'll sort this out straight away, won't take more than a tick. \n",
            "\n",
            "\"Now-now\" is a phrase commonly used in South African English meaning shortly or soon, this is not used in British English. The term \"fix\" can be replaced with \"sort out\" which is more common in British English. The phrase \"more than a minute\" can be swapped with \"more than a tick\" as \"tick\" is a somewhat informal British term for moment or instant.\n",
            "17 We can go makan at the hawker centre later.\n",
            "Australian: We can head over to the food court for some tucker later.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: The phrase \"go makan\" in the original sentence is not English but Malay for \"go eat\". In Australian English, the common term for eating could simply be \"head over for some tucker\". \"Hawker centre\" is Singaporean English for a type of food court, so in Australian English, it is simply translated as \"food court\". Australians also tend to use the phrase \"head over\" instead of \"go\".\n",
            "18 You better study hard for the exam, if not later you regret.\n",
            "Australian: You'd better hit the books hard for the test, mate, otherwise you'll be spewin' later. \n",
            "\n",
            "In Australia, \"study\" can be referred to in a casual context as \"hit the books\". The use of \"mate\" is an iconic Australian way of referring to friends and people in general. \"Spewin'\" is Australian slang, typically implying great disappointment, similar to 'regret'.\n",
            "19 Eh, you very kiasu leh, always must be first in everything.\n",
            "Australian: Mate, you're a bit too competitive, always gotta be first in everything.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: 'Eh' in Singapore English (Singlish) can be translated to 'Mate' in Australian English as it is often used informally to address someone. 'Kiasu' is a Singlish term meaning overly competitive or afraid to lose out, this concept can be translated to 'a bit too competitive.' Lastly, 'leh' is a Singlish discourse particle that does not have an equivalent in standard English, so it is omitted in the Aussie translation.\n",
            "20 That ice cream was so shiok.\n",
            "Indian: That ice cream was truly first-rate yaar. \n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: The term \"shiok\" which is commonly used in Singapore and Malaysia to denote delicious or relishing food. In Indian English, there's no direct equivalent, but phrases like \"first-rate\" or \"top-class\" can be used to express a similar sentiment. The term \"yaar\" is a common informal term used in Indian English to mean \"friend\" or \"mate\", similar to \"dude\" or \"bro\" in American English.\n",
            "21 Have you finished your homework already or not?\n",
            "Indian: Have you done with your homework or still doing it na?\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: The word 'na' is commonly used at the end of sentences or questions in Indian English. It is used to seek agreement or confirmation, similar to 'isn't it?', 'right?' or 'no?' in British English. Also, the phrase 'done with' is more common than 'finished' when talking about completing tasks like homework.\n",
            "22 We need to submit this project by next week, can or not?\n",
            "Indian: We have to give this project by next week, is it doable or not?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: Indian English usually uses formal and more explicit verbiage. The term \"can or not?\" is more common in Singlish (Singapore English) or Manglish (Malaysian English). The phrase \"is it doable or not?\" or \"possible or not?\" is a more direct translation in Indian English. Also, the verb \"submit\" might be replaced by \"give\" in casual Indian English conversation.\n",
            "23 He drives so fast, quite scary sometimes.\n",
            "British: He drives so fast, quite frightful at times. \n",
            "\n",
            "In British English, the term \"frightful\" is generally used as a more typical expression to represent something scary or alarming.\n",
            "24 Very sad actually, because I'm in the age pool where some people for some reason, have to go to the hospital\n",
            "British: It's a real shame actually, because I'm at that age where, for some reason, some blokes have to pop off to the hospital.\n",
            "\n",
            "In this translation, \"very sad\" has been replaced with the more British English phrase \"a real shame\". \"Age pool\" has been retained as is appropriate in British English too. The phrase \"for some reason, some people\" is translated as \"for some reason, some blokes\" as \"blokes\" is a British slang term for \"guys\" or \"men\". Lastly, \"have to go to\" is replaced by \"have to pop off to\" as \"pop off to\" is a colloquially British way to say \"go to\".\n",
            "25 She so garang, speaking up during meetings.\n",
            "British: She's rather feisty, speaking up during meetings. \n",
            "\n",
            "\"Garang\" is a dialect word from Singapore English (Singlish) and it suggests someone being fierce or aggressive. British English does not contain an exact term for this, but 'feisty' could be used as it refers to someone who is assertive and spirited.\n",
            "26 We are having some mates over for a barbie sarvo, you should come!\n",
            "Singaporean: We got some kakis coming over for a BBQ this afternoon, you should join la! \n",
            "\n",
            "\"Kaki\" is a colloquial term often used in Singapore to refer to buddies or friends. \"La\" is a common phrase ending sound in Singlish, it doesn't particularly mean anything but it's often used to soften a sentence or to emphasize the point.\n",
            "27 He's a few roo's loose in the top paddock\n",
            "Singaporean: The translated sentence in Singaporean English would be: \"He got a few screws loose upstairs lah.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, the phrase \"a few screws loose upstairs\" is commonly used to describe someone with odd or eccentric behavior, signifying that the person isn't thinking clearly or is out of touch with reality. This is similar to the Australian slang “he’s a few roo's loose in the top paddock.” The word \"lah\" is a unique Singlish particle that often appears at the end of statements for emphasis or to soften a request or command. It doesn't have a specific English translation.\n",
            "28 I'm muzzed after that afterparty, it was a ripper of a party\n",
            "Singaporean: I'm damn shagged after that party, it was seriously solid one sia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: The use of \"damn\" in Singaporean English serves to emphasize or exaggerate a point, similar to how \"muzzed\" is used in the original sentence. \"Shagged\" is often used in Singaporean English to mean tired or exhausted. \"Solid\" is used to describe something that's impressive or good, substituting \"ripper\" from the original sentence. \"Sia\" is a Singlish particle for emphasis, often added at the end of sentences.\n",
            "29 Accadaccas is something the Aussie feel proud of ,since it’s a rock band that has its origins in Australia\n",
            "Indian: The Indian English version could be: \"AC/DC is something Aussies take pride in, yaar, because it's a rock band that has its roots in Australia.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "Indian English often incorporates words from Indian languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, and others. The term \"yaar\" is a Hindi term that is used in casual conversation to refer to a friend or mate, similar to \"dude\" or \"buddy.\" It is widely used in Indian English conversations between friends and peers.\n",
            "30 It's Friday, usually a g'day to be on the piss with mates\n",
            "Indian: It's Friday, typically a good day to have a drink with friends, no?\n",
            "\n",
            "Indian English is generally more formal and less slangy compared to other English dialects. The phrase \"on the piss\" is Australian slang for drinking alcohol, which isn't commonly used in India. The term \"mates\" is also not often used and would be replaced with \"friends\". Adding a softener like \"no?\" at the end of the sentence is common in Indian English to invite agreement or confirmation.\n",
            "31 It’s the chrissie pressie, the best thing to open on a Sunday\n",
            "Indian: \"It's the Christmas gift, the best thing to open on a Sunday, mate.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The term \"chrissie pressie\" is not typical in Indian English. While the concept of Christmas is understood, more common terminology and phrasing would be used. Furthermore, in Indian English, endearing terms like \"mate\" or \"friend\" might often be used.\n",
            "32 Can yo spare a few bucks? Need it to exit the parking.\n",
            "British: Can you spare a few quid? Need it for the car park exit. \n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In British English, \"bucks\" (a slang term for dollars in American English) is replaced with \"quid\", a slang term for pounds. Similarly, \"parking\" is usually referred to as \"car park\" in British English.\n",
            "33 nah yeah, lets get on this boat and have fun\n",
            "British: Right, let's hop on this boat and enjoy ourselves. \n",
            "\n",
            "In British English, especially in terms of its colloquial language, phrases such as \"nah yeah\" are actually quite uncommon. instead, simple affirmatives like \"right,\" or \"ok\" are commonly used to convey agreement or the intent to commence an activity. Furthermore, \"lets get on\" can simply be changed to \"let's hop on.\" Brits may use the term \"have fun\" just as Americans do, but \"enjoy ourselves\" gives it a more British nuance.\n",
            "34 Tim is a bludger, he always tries to sneak his way out of difficult situations\n",
            "British: Tim is a skiver, he always tries to dodge his way out of sticky situations. \n",
            "\n",
            "In British English, 'bludger' (Australian slang for a lazy person) is often replaced with 'skiver'. Similarly, 'sneak' is more colloquially represented by 'dodge', and 'difficult' situations are described as 'sticky' situations.\n",
            "35 I have a kutti announcement, we are having a party at our place\n",
            "Singaporean: \"Got a bit of news leh, we are throwing a party at our place lor.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In Singaporean English, often referred to as Singlish, 'Got' is commonly used as a replacement for 'have'. 'Leh' is a particle usually used at the end of a statement to soften its tone or to express a suggestion. 'Lor' is used at the end of a sentence to signify an acceptance of a situation.\n",

            "Singaporean: Everytime he give one missed call, I think he never top up his phone one. \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: In Singaporean English, often known as Singlish, 'give one missed call' is often used instead of 'sends a missed call'. 'Never' is commonly used in place of 'doesn't' or 'hasn't'. The word 'one' is often used at the end of sentences for emphasis. 'Top up' is used in reference to adding credit to a prepaid mobile phone.\n",
            "37 This watchman keep shouting something or the other, he never keeps quiet.\n",
            "Singaporean: This jaga always anyhow shout here and there, never can keep quiet one.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Singapore English (Singlish), 'Jaga' is a term used for watchman or guard, derived from Malay language. 'Anyhow' is used instead of 'something or the other', and 'one' is often used at the end of sentences to emphasise the point. The phrase 'never can keep quiet' is typical Singlish phrasing.\n",
            "38 These boys don't like to complete their homework, they always disobey teacher and laugh like that only, \n",
            "Australian: These blokes don't enjoy doing their homework, they're always giving the teacher a hard time and just sit there having a laugh.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: \"Boy\" in Australian English is often translated to \"bloke\". Australians also use the phrase \"giving a hard time\" to mean \"disobeying or causing trouble\". The phrase \"laugh like that only\" was adapted to \"just sit there having a laugh\" to capture the same concept using Australian English vernacular.\n",
            "39 Don't worry about the predicted results, ill try my level best to get something close enough\n",
            "Australian: Mate, don't stress about the predicted results, I'll do my best to get something close enough.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: \"Dude\" is typically replaced with \"mate\" in Australian English. Furthermore, the phrase \"I'll try my level best\" would typically be simplified and made more casual, to something like \"I'll do my best\".\n",
            "40 I would like to introduce you to my 'would be’\n",
            "Australian: I'd like to introduce you to my 'would be'.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a dialectologist, it is important to retain the core meaning of the sentence while adapting it to the specific dialect. However, the phrase 'would be' meaning a future partner or spouse is common amongst all English dialects including Australian English. Since there is no special Australian term or phrasing for 'would be', the sentence remains the same.\n",
            "41 I have a doubt, are you planning on going back home and then return, or come directly with us?\n",
            "British: Are you having a think about going home first and then coming back, or are you coming straight along with us?\n",
            "\n",
            "In this British English translation, the American phrase 'having a doubt' is replaced with a more common British English phrase 'having a think' which makes more sense to a UK-based English speaker. Additionally, 'going back home' is just 'going home' in British English and 'come directly with us' can be translated as 'coming straight along with us'.\n",
            "42 Very rough fellow, doesn't know how to handle with care.\n",
            "British: Quite a rough bloke, doesn't know how to handle with care. \n",
            "\n",
            "In Britain, people use the term 'bloke' to refer to a man or a 'guy', thus replacing 'fellow'. The structure and sense of the sentence remain unchanged.\n",
            "43 Kindly adjust the car seat. The people in the back can't sit properly\n",
            "British: Could you move your seat forward, mate? The folks in the back aren't able to sit right.\n",
            "\n",
            "In British English, \"Kindly adjust\" can feel quite formal; using \"could you\" instead fits most conversational contexts better. We also use \"mate\" in a casual interaction with friends, which is equivalent to the American \"dude\". The term \"folks\" is used informally to refer to a group of people and is widely used in both American and British English. Finally, \"aren't able to sit right\" carries the same meaning as \"can't sit properly\" but seemed like a more informal, conversational choice suitable for this context.\n",
            "44 You don’t need to live here. I could get you into a nicer home. You know – prettier nurses, tea that comes on time.\n",
            "Singaporean: No need to stay here one, I can chope better place for you. Got chio nurses also, and your teh come punctual.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Singaporean English (also known as Singlish), \"No need\" is often used instead of \"You don't need\". \"One\" is a particle used for emphasis. \"Chope\" is a colloquial term for \"reserve\". \"Chio\" is a Singlish slang meaning attractive or good-looking and \"Teh\" is a term for tea. \"Punctual\" is a common way of referring to something that happens on time. The translation keeps the same meaning but in a style conversational to a Singaporean audience.\n",
            "45 She’s the second youngest in the house, after me of course, but the only other real adult apart from mum\n",
            "Singaporean: She one the second paiseh one in the house hor, after me lah but she the only other big people other than mum one leh.\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation:\n",
            "In Singlish or Singaporean English, \"one\" is often used at the end of sentences for emphasis. \"Hor\" and \"lah\" are discourse particles commonly used in Singlish. \"Hor\" is mostly used in agreement or when seeking agreement in a gentle manner and \"lah\" is a well-known Singlish particle, often used for assertion. \"Paiseh\" is a term commonly used to denote 'shy' or 'embarrassed', but in this context it's used to refer to someone younger, in a playful way. \"Big people\" is a direct translation for adults, used colloquially in Singlish.\n",
            "46 John They don’t know their arse from their elbow there. They don’t know sod all about music there\n",
            "Singaporean: Translation: \"Wah, they really blur like sotong there leh. They don't know zilch about music lor.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In Singlish (Singaporean English), \"blur like sotong\" is a common phrase used to describe someone who is completely clueless, much like the English phrase \"don't know their arse from their elbow\". \"Wah\" is a common interjection used to express surprise or disbelief. \"Lor\" is frequently used at the end of sentences to stress a point or show resignation or acceptance, similar to \"there\" in the original sentence. \"Zilch\" is a slang term for \"nothing\" which is understood in most English dialects, including Singlish.\n",
            "47 merger or no merger, and let me say, very hastily at this point, that if you don’t all shout merger, this will be an extremely short pantomime\n",
            "Australian: Merge or no merge, and let me just add real quick here, if you all don't yell out merge, this is gonna be a bloody short panto.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Australians often use the term 'bloody' for emphasis, similar to how Americans might use 'damn' or 'really.' 'Pantomime' is universally understood, but it's got a different colloquial term in Australia as 'panto.'\"\n",
            "48 Aye it's not nice. Lots of druggies, scroungers, you know\n",
            "Australian: 'Mate, it's not flash. Tons of druggies, bludgers, you know.'\n",
            "\n",
            "This translation changes the American \"Aye it's not nice\" to the Australian greeting \"Mate\", and substitutes \"flash\" for \"nice\" as it is a common Australian slang for good or impressive. The term \"druggies\" stays the same as it is common language in both dialects. \"Scroungers\" changes to \"bludgers\" as this refers to a person who avoids work and sponges off others in Australian slang.\n",
            "49 Without further ado I’ll let my darling wife Betty and my special daughter Emily do the revealing honours\n",
            "Australian: Without further ado, I'll let me beautiful wife Betty and me precious daughter Emily do the reveal. \n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: \"Darling\" and \"special\" are replaced with \"beautiful\" and \"precious\" respectively as these are common terms of endearments used in Australia. The word \"honours\" is simply reduced to \"reveal\" to reflect a more casual, laid-back Australian conversation style. \"My\" is also swapped with the more colloquial \"me\".\n",
            "50 She’s also completely bonkers. Always seems to be worrying about what someone thinks\n",
            "Indian: She’s also absolutely batty. Forever stressing about what someone else may be thinking, isn't it?\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: In Indian English, 'batty' is commonly used to refer someone who is crazy or eccentric, similar to the use of 'bonkers' in American English. The phrase \"isn't it?\" at the end of the sentence is characteristic of Indian English as an enforcement of the point or a seeking of agreement, akin to the use of 'right?' in American English.\n",
            "51 Skinny chap with a beard in a de-mob suit, and that knife up there in his kitbag\n",
            "Indian: Thin fellow with a beard in a retired soldier's attire, and that knife up there in his luggage mate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: \"Skinny chap\" translates to \"Thin fellow\" as 'fellow' is commonly used to refer to a man in Indian English. \"De-mob suit\" is a very British phrase. In Indian English, it could be translated to \"retired soldier's attire\" to make it more understandable, because the term \"de-mob\" generally refers to demobilization or discharge from a military service. Lastly, \"kitbag\" translates to \"luggage\" which is a more widespread term used in Indian English. \"Mate\" is often used colloquially and is similar in usage to 'pal' or 'dude'.\n",
            "52 He fell off the stage at the Wigmore Hall and broke his leg, poor sod. So he offered me the holiday\n",
            "Indian: He tumbled off the stage at Wigmore Hall and fractured his leg, poor chap. So, he handed me the holiday.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reasoning: \n",
            "The term \"sod\" is largely associated with British dialects and is not very common in Indian English. It has been substituted with \"chap\", a term more frequently used in Indian English. \"He offered\" has been changed to \"he handed\", which suits Indian English better in this context.\n"

            "Indian: Indians generally use \"friends\" or \"buddies\" instead of \"mates,\" and \"barbecue\" would be the full term used instead of \"barbie.\" \"Sarvo,\" meaning this afternoon, is an Australian term not typically found in Indian English. A more common way to say this in India might be \"later today\" or \"this evening.\" Food parties are very common and loved in India, so this concept translates well.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, in Indian English it could be: \"We're having some friends over for a barbecue this evening. You should come!\"\n",
            "2 He's a few roo's loose in the top paddock\n",
            "Indian: This Australian English idiom means that someone is not very intelligent or is behaving in a crazy manner. In Indian English, the concept of someone being not very wise can be conveyed with phrases like 'A bit dim in the head' or 'Not the brightest bulb'. Therefore, this sentence can be translated to Indian English as 'He's a bit dim in the head.'\n",
            "3 I'm muzzed after that afterparty, it was a ripper of a party\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English context, the words like 'muzzed', 'afterparty' and 'ripper of a party' might need some adjustment. \n",
            "\n",
            "'Muzzed' usually means extremely tired or exhausted which could be translated as 'fagged out'.  \n",
            "'Afterparty' can simply remain as it is because Indian English speakers understand this term - it's a party that is held after a larger or main event.\n",
            "'Ripper of a party' means an excellent or very good party. Indian English speakers often use terms such as 'dhamaal' (fun-filled), 'banging' or 'blast' to express similar sentiments. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, given all this, a likely translation for your sentence could be: \"I'm completely fagged out after that afterparty, it was a real dhamaal!\"\n",
            "4 Accadaccas is something the Aussie feel proud of ,since it’s a rock band that has its origins in Australia\n",
            "Indian: Indians have a similar pride for their localities and traditional values. Moreover, they don't usually use the term 'Aussie' for Australians. Instead, they often refer to them colloquially as 'Australians'. Moreover, Indians may not be aware of Accadaccas being Australian slang for rock band AC/DC, so a translation should include the actual name of the band. The term 'rock band' can be retained as Indians are familiar with this term. \n",
            "\n",
            "Considering these factors, the translated sentence would be: \"AC/DC is something we Indians feel proud of, since it’s a rock band that originated in Australia.\"\n",
            "5 It's Friday, usually a g'day to be on the piss with mates\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English dialect, the sentence could be translated as \"It's Friday, usually a good day to have a drink with friends.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "Indian English has British English as its base, hence doesn't necessarily have terms equivalent to Australian English phrases such as 'g'day' (an Australian informal greeting which means good day) or 'on the piss' (an Australian slang referring to drinking alcohol). Instead, a more direct and less colloquial language is generally used as shown in the translation. 'Mates' is replaced with 'friends', a term more commonly used in Indian English. So, the cultural references and unique expressions of Australian English are replaced with direct, simple English terminologies that cater to an Indian audience.\n",
            "6 That film was brilliant, so it was.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English uses a different set of colloquialisms and phrase structures compared to British or American English. For example, Indian English might use 'wasn't it?' as a tag question at the end of a sentence, instead of 'so it was'. Also, instead of 'brilliant', Indian English might use 'fantastic' or 'superb'. The translation would then be: 'That film was superb, wasn't it?'\n",
            "7 I’ve a notion to bake some soda bread this afternoon, would you like some?\n",
            "Indian: Indian English is influenced by local languages and culture. Light banter typically abounds in Indian English conversations, oftentimes replete with regional touch. Direct addresses like 'friend', 'mate', 'brother'(bhai), 'comrade' among others are also fairly common, while also maintaining a significant formality in usage of language. A heavily common Indian term to showcase any kind of inclination is 'Mood' or 'Dil' (Dil translates to heart in English). \n",
            "\n",
            "Keeping all of this in mind, we could reinterpret the sentence as follows: 'Friend, I'm in the mood to whip up some soda bread this afternoon, fancy a slice?'\n",
            "8 It's a soft day, thank God, just a light drizzle.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English has been greatly influenced by British English, yet it has its own unique blend of idioms, phrases and words drawn from several local languages of India. The phrase 'soft day' is Irish in origin and refers to a weather event that’s somewhat a mix of mist and drizzle. The equivalent in Indian English might be 'gentle monsoon day'.\n",
            "\n",
            "The phrase 'thank God' is universal, but in India, we might instead sometimes say 'thank the gods', reflecting the country's polytheistic beliefs. Supplanting 'Thank God' with 'Thanks to the gods' would, therefore, be a better fit to the Indian context.\n",
            "\n",
            "Considering all these cultural nuances, the sentence 'It's a soft day, thank God, just a light drizzle.' can be translated to Indian English as, 'It's a gentle monsoon day, thanks to the gods, just a little spritz.'\n",
            "9 I'm after getting a new job in the city, so I am.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English, though derived from British English, has its own distinctive vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, and has incorporated many local languages and cultural references. Indians often use a more formal language in conversational English and there are certain phrases and words that are distinct to Indian English. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the context of the given sentence, the Indian English equivalent could be, \"I have secured a new job in the city, isn't it?\" The phrase \"isn't it\" is a common tag question used at the end of statements in Indian English, similar to \"so I am\" in the original sentence. It is a direct translation of the Hindi phrase 'hai na?', and is used irrespective of the grammatical number or gender of the subject. Also, the use of the word 'secured' instead of 'getting' reflects a more formal language usage, which is typical of Indian English.\n",
            "10 Let’s have a wee chat over a cup of coffee, shall we?\n",
            "Indian: Indian English often includes a mix of Hindi and English, affectionately termed \"Hinglish\". \"Cup of coffee\" may be replaced with the Hinglish phrase \"cup of chai\", referring to the chai tea that is very popular in India. \"Wee\" is a bit more associated with Scottish English, so it may not be used in Indian English as frequently. Additionally, in Indian conversation, the tone is often more formal and respectful. Polite phrases such as \"if you don't mind\" are used often. \n",
            "\n",
            "Translated version: \n",
            "\"Shall we have a small conversation over a cup of chai, if you don't mind?\"\n",
            "11 You don’t need to live here. I could get you into a nicer home. You know – prettier nurses, tea that comes on time.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English tends to be more formal and slightly more ornamented in comparison to American English. Pleasantries are more significant, and there is a preference for British spellings and terms due to historical ties to the UK. The use of honorary titles (\"sir,\" \"madam,\" etc.) is also common. Further, certain words are distinctly Indian. For example, 'flat' instead of 'apartment'. So keeping these aspects in mind, the sentence could be translated into Indian English as:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"You need not reside here, sir. I can certainly arrange for you a far better abode. You understand - more charming nurses, and the chai arriving promptly.\"\n",
            "12 She’s the second youngest in the house, after me of course, but the only other real adult apart from mum\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English, familial words may be used more frequently in place of pronouns to indicate relationships and hierarchies. Sibling ranks are also very important, so the term \"second youngest\" would likely be understood instantly. Expressions concerning age also slightly differ - \"real adult\" may not necessarily be recognized. Instead, acknowledging their responsibility or role in the house/ family is more relatable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Translating this to Indian English keeping the cultural nuances in mind, it would look something like this: \n",
            "\n",
            "\"She’s the one just older than me in the house, but apart from mum, she's the only other person who takes on any serious responsibilities.\"\n",
            "13 John They don’t know their arse from their elbow there. They don’t know sod all about music there\n",
            "Indian: Indian English, colloquially known as Hinglish, combines Hindi and English, the two major languages in India. It is a mix and adaptation of English taking into account the socio-cultural nuances of India. \n",
            "\n",
            "The elements to consider in this translation are:\n",
            "\n",
            "- \"John\": This, being a name, would stay the same across dialects.\n",
            "- \"They don’t know their arse from their elbow there\": This phrase is used in a derogatory sense to say someone is completely incompetent or ignorant. A similar expression in Indian English would be \"They don’t know their head from their tail there.\"\n",
            "- \"They don’t know sod all about music there\": In British English, this phrase means that they know nothing or very little about music. A similar expression in Indian English would be \"Wahan music ke bare mein inko kuch bhi nahi pata\", which translates to \"They don't know anything about music there\" in English. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, the translated sentence in Indian English would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"John, wahan inko apne sir aur poonch ka farak nahi pata. Wahan music ke bare mein inko kuch bhi nahi pata.\"\n",
            "14 merger or no merger, and let me say, very hastily at this point, that if you don’t all shout merger, this will be an extremely short pantomime\n",
            "Indian: Indian English often makes use of inclusive language and is usually less concise. It includes more explanatory terms and a formal tone. It tends to rely more on British English due to historical influences but makes use of unique Indian terminologies. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of this sentence, we might use words like ‘consolidation’ instead of merger (for a more formal, business-like connotation), ‘quickly’ instead of hastily, and ‘drama’ instead of pantomime (since the term pantomime isn't as commonly used in India). ‘Shout’ could be replaced with 'proclaim' to provide a more dramatic flair.\n",
            "\n",
            "Translating the sentence:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Consolidation or no consolidation, and let me state, quite quickly at this point, that if you all don't collectively proclaim 'merger', this will be an extremely brief drama.\"\n",
            "15 Aye it's not nice. Lots of druggies, scroungers, you know\n",
            "Indian: Indian English tends to incorporate terms and phrases from various Indian languages and uses certain British English words more frequently than American English. Also, Indian English usually uses more formal language.\n",
            "\n",
            "Translation: Oh, it's really not good. So many drug addicts and people living off others, you see.\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: The phrase \"Aye it's not nice\" translates fairly directly into Indian English as \"Oh, it's really not good.\" The term \"druggies\" which denotes drug addicts, remains the same in Indian English. \"Scroungers\" can be translated as \"people living off others\" since the term isn't commonly used in Indian English. The colloquial phrase \"you know\" often translates to \"you see\" in polite Indian English conversation.\n",
            "16 I was thinking of going to the beach, just now, if the weather holds up.\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English, a more casual and local lingo is frequently used. \"Going to\" is often translated as \"heading towards\" and \"Just now\" is commonly used as 'just now only', adding emphasis to convey immediacy. 'If the weather holds up' can be translated as 'if the climate supports'. The term \"was thinking\" can be replaced with 'was planning'. Thus, the translated sentence would read, \"I was planning to head towards the beach, just now only, if the climate supports.\"\n",
            "17 You're going to the game, not so?\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English, a direct translation could be: \"You are going to the match, isn't it?\" Here, instead of \"game\", it's more common to use \"match\". The tag question \"isn't it?\" is often used in Indian English in place of \"not so?\".\n",
            "18 I’ll fix this now-now, won’t take more than a minute.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English has primarily been influenced by Hindi and many other native languages across India. A prominent feature of Indian English is the use of English words directly translated or adapted from native languages. \n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, the prompt \"I'll fix this now-now, won't take more than a minute\" is largely similar in vocabulary usage to standard English. However, the term \"now-now\" can be replaced with a phrase commonly used in Indian English for immediate or quick action. \n",
            "\n",
            "Hence, translating this into Indian English, it might become: \"I'll set this right jaldi (fast), won't consume much time.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "Here, the term 'jaldi' is a direct adaptation from Hindi which means fast or quickly. This example underlines the direct influence of native languages on Indian English.\n",
            "19 Eish, I forgot to call him back yesterday, now it’s too late.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English differs from Standard British or American English in a number of ways, including vocabulary, syntax, and idiomatic expressions. In Indian English, colloquial terms, specific local references, and expressions from various Indian languages are often incorporated into everyday speech.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conversion: 'Oh dear, I failed to call him back yesterday; now it is simply too late.' \n",
            "\n",
            "In this translation, \"Eish\" is replaced with \"Oh dear\", which is a widely used phrase in India to express surprise or disappointment. Similarly, the straightforward sentence \"I forgot to call him back yesterday\" is turned into \"I failed to call him back yesterday\", which adds a bit more formality and seriousness to the statement – a general characteristic of Indian English. The contraction \"it's\" is expanded to \"it is\", reflecting the more formal and explicit way of speaking in Indian English. The term \"simply\" is a common adverb in Indian English used to emphasize the point, in this case, emphasizing the lateness.\n",
            "20 That rugby match was an absolute jol last night.\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English, one might translate 'jol' to 'tamasha' or 'masti', both of which mean fun or entertainment. 'Last night' may also be expressed in a more informal way such as 'kal raat'. So after considering those changes, the translated sentence would be: 'That rugby match was quite a masti kal raat.'\n",
            "21 We can go makan at the hawker centre later.\n",
            "Indian: The sentence seems to include a blend of English with Singaporean/Malaysian language (typically known as Singlish or Manglish) rather than Indian English. The word 'makan' means 'eat' and 'hawker centre' is a type of food court popular in Malaysia and Singapore. To translate this into Indian English, we'd replace 'makan' with 'eat' or 'have food' and instead of 'hawker centre,' we would most likely use 'food court' or 'restaurant.' So the sentence would translate as, \"We can go eat at the restaurant later\" or \"We can have food at the food court later\" in Indian English. However, we must remember that in India, English is amalgamated with several regional languages, and the use of English may vary widely. Thus, the translation may differ based on the regional influence.\n",
            "22 You better study hard for the exam, if not later you regret.\n",
            "Indian: Chain of thought: In Indian English, the word 'better' can often be swapped for 'should' to mean 'ought to.' The phrase 'if not later you regret' can be rephrased to 'otherwise you'll lament it later.' Also, the use of friendly threats or warnings is common, and it’s also usual to use more formal or explanatory language. \n",
            "\n",
            "Translation: You should be devotedly studying for your examination, otherwise you'll end up lamenting it later, my dear friend.\n",
            "23 Eh, you very kiasu leh, always must be first in everything.\n",
            "Indian: The phrase initially comes across as Singapore Colloquial English or Singlish, with \"kiasu\" referring to someone who is obsessively competitive, not wanting to miss out on any opportunity. However, let's translate it into Indian English:\n",
            "\n",
            "It seems you're always driven to outdo others and be the leading one in everything, yaar.\n",
            "\n",

            "24 That ice cream was so shiok.\n",
            "Indian: Indian English prominently uses words borrowed from Hindi and other local languages. It also involves the use of more formal words. \n",
            "\n",
            "In this case, the word \"shiok\" is a Singlish term referring to something extremely satisfying or delicious, which is not commonly used in Indian English. An equivalent for 'shiok' used in India could be 'tasty', 'flavoursome', or 'yummy'. However, it's important to note that much of the informal vocabulary differs among different regions in India. Since 'ice cream' is a universally liked food, we could use a more generic, widely understood term.\n",
            "\n",
            "Translation: \n",
            "'That ice cream was awfully delightful.'\n",
            "25 Have you finished your homework already or not?\n",
            "Indian: The chain of thought here mainly involves making the language more casual and more familiar to Indian English. The phrase \"or not?\" is a direct translation of a common Hindi phrasing, where this question would be asked in a slightly different structure. The term \"friend\" is often used as a direct address in Indian English, taking cues from similar usage in various Indian languages. So, the translated sentence could be:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Friend, have you done your homework or what?\"\n",
            "26 We need to submit this project by next week, can or not?\n",
            "Indian: In Indian English, we generally tend to use more formal language when communicating about work or professional matters. The use of colloquial language is limited in formal scenarios. The question 'can or not?' would be replaced by 'is it possible?' which is typically used to ask for confirmation or feasibility of a task. \n",
            "\n",
            "The translated sentence would be, \"We need to submit this project by the upcoming week, is it possible?\"\n",
            "27 He drives so fast, quite scary sometimes.\n",
            "Indian: The chain of thought here is to incorporate an Indian English context. Indians often use 'yaar' in conversation, much like 'dude' or 'pal' and 'frightening' instead of 'scary.' Hence, the translated sentence would be: 'He drives so fast, quite frightening sometimes yaar.'\n",
            "28 Very sad actually, because I'm in the age pool where some people for some reason, have to go to the hospital\n",
            "Indian: Indian English tends to use some specific terms and expressions. For instance, \"actually\" is often used to indicate a conclusion or sum up a thought, \"some reason\" might be replaced by \"one reason or another,\" addressing indirectness and general uncertainty more expressively. Also, \"have to\" might be replaced by \"need to,\" as it's often used instead in Indian English. \n",
            "\n",

            "29 She so garang, speaking up during meetings.\n",
            "Indian: The sentence involves the use of the word 'garang', which is a Malay term predominantly used in Singapore to describe someone as fierce, tough, or aggressive. This isn't common in Indian English, where we use straightforward English terms or Hindi-influenced terms. \n",
            "\n",
            "For the term 'speaking up during meetings' - this can be left as it is since it is commonly used across various English-speaking countries, including India. \n",
            "\n",
            "Considering this, the translation would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "'She is quite bold, voicing her opinions during meetings.' \n",
            "\n",
            "In Indian English it's common to use Hindi-derived words like ‘daring’ or 'bold' to describe someone assertive or outspoken. Other cultural context or colloquial terms are put straightaway without much modification in sentence structure.\n",
            "30 I think he like sotong, go all the way there for nothing.\n",
            "Indian: The given prompt is structured with eclectic slang and phrases more common to Singapore English or Singlish.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the translation into Indian English requires rephrasing it more fluidly and naturally to fit into the Indian context. Firstly, 'sotong' is a Malay word which essentially means 'squid', but, in Singapore, this term is colloquially used to describe someone who is clueless or has done something foolish. \n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, 'go all the way there for nothing' is equivalent to having made a great effort or having gone to some trouble, only to not achieve anything, or for no result.\n",
            "\n",
            "To translate this into Indian English while incorporating some Indian English slang and idioms, my chain of thinking is:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I think he is like sotong\" -> \"I think he is a hare-brained fellow\" (Here, we're replacing 'sotong' (foolish) with a phrase commonly used in India to address someone who is clueless or foolish.)\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Go all the way there for nothing.\" -> \"He made such a hullabaloo just for no gains.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the final translation in Indian English is: \"I reckon he's hare-brained, going that far only to achieve nothing.\" \n",

            "\n",
            "The phrase 'it's a grand day' can be translated to 'good weather', and 'outside for a walk' could be translated to 'go jalan-jalan' since Singlish often refers to going out casually or being out and about as 'jalan-jalan' taken from Malay. 'Isn't it?' could be converted to the Singlish expression 'is it not?', to mirror the casual and distinctive style of Singlish.\n",
            "\n",
            "So the sentence 'Sure, it's a grand day outside for a walk, isn't it?' can be translated to 'Confirm, good weather to go jalan-jalan outside, is it not?' in Singaporean English.\n",
            "32 I'll meet you down at the pub later for a pint.\n",
            "Singaporean: Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, mostly incorporates terms from the English, Malay, Hokkien, Teochew, and Tamil. \n",
            "\n",
            "In this case, Singaporeans often use the term 'lah' at the end of sentences for emphasis. They use 'makan' for eating and 'kena' for having or needing to do something. \n",

            "33 We're just having a bit of craic at the party.\n",
            "Singaporean: Chain of Thought: Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, boasts of its unique colloquial slangs and terms incorporated from various languages like Malay, Tamil, and Chinese. The term 'craic' is distinctly Irish and isn't used in Singlish. Instead, Singaporeans might use 'fun' or 'joking around' which is often used to signify fun activities or laughter-inducing conversation at a gathering or party. \n",
            "\n",
            "Translation: \"We just there, at the party having fun only lah.\"\n",
            "34 I'm feeling a bit peckish; could you pass the Tayto crisps?\n",
            "Singaporean: Singaporeans often use “Hungry” instead of “peckish”, and \"cannot tahan\" to imply they can't bear or resist the hunger. They also refer to crisp as potato chips and typically use brand names less frequently. In place of \"pass,\" they might say \"pass over.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the sentence \"I'm feeling a bit peckish; could you pass the Tayto crisps?\" could be translated in Singaporean English to \"So hungry, cannot tahan; can pass over the potato chips?\"\n",
            "35 Would you be after stopping at the shop for some milk?\n",
            "Singaporean: The sentence \"Would you be after stopping at the shop for some milk?\" is translated to Singaporean English as \"Can help to go shop buy some milk or not?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In Singapore, locals speak a unique slang, Singlish, which is an English-based creole language mixed with words from Hokkien, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. There's a preference for using more direct phrases. So instead of \"Would you be after stopping at the shop\", Singlish would use \"Can help to go shop\". \"For some milk\" is also translated directly to \"buy some milk\". \"Or not\" is a common Singlish phrase used in questions.\n",
            "36 It’s the chrissie pressie, the best thing to open on a Sunday\n",
            "Singaporean: Singaporean English, often known as Singlish, includes a mix of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Tamil, and other languages. Abbreviating words is also common in Singlish, as seen in the mention of 'the chrissie pressie'. There's a noticeable change of tonality and pace, often featuring altered grammar and syntax rules.\n",
            "\n",
            "In breaking down 'It’s the chrissie pressie, the best thing to open on a Sunday', we understand it to mean 'It's the Christmas present, the best thing to open on a Sunday'. In Singaporean English, we might say, \"It's the Christmas ang pow, best thing to kioh on a Sunday.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "'Ang pow' refers to 'Red envelopes or packets' that are usually used for gift giving in Chinese culture where 'kioh' is Singaporean slang for 'receive or collect'. The use of these regional slang terms and the more casual, colloquial tone capture the distinct characteristics of tenor, tempo and turns in the local language.\n",
            "37 Can yo spare a few bucks? Need it to exit the parking.\n",
            "Singaporean: In Singaporean English, commonly known as Singlish, the translation tries to capture the informal and direct nature of the language. Phrases like \"Can borrow\" are used instead of \"Can you spare\", and \"a few bucks\" turns into \"some money\". The term \"bucks\" isn't as common in Singapore, we would generally use \"money\" instead. In conclusion, the sentence: 'Can you spare a few bucks? I need it to exit the parking.' translates to 'Can borrow some money not? Need to get out of the parking one.'\n",
            "38 nah yeah, lets get on this boat and have fun\n",
            "Singaporean: In the context of Singaporean English or Singlish, a closer translation would be: \"Come lah, we go this boat enjoy a bit.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Explanation: Singlish often features interjections of local phrases in the English context. The phrase 'nah yeah' can be translated to 'Come' in Singlish. The term 'lah' is often added to denote a softer tone or emotion. The conjunction 'and' is often replaced by switching sentence structures i.e., 'we go this boat.\" 'Have fun' is casually phrased as 'enjoy a bit', analogous to having a bit of fun.\n",

            "Singaporean: In Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, local slang or colloquial terms often replace standard English ones. 'Maccas' is an Australian English term for McDonald's, which is not used in Singapore. Singaporeans just usually call it 'MacD' or 'McD'. So the translation would be: 'Let's go eat burger at McD lah, can make the kids happy.\" Singaporeans often use the particle 'lah' for emphasis, and 'can make the kids happy' is a more local way of saying 'might put a smile on the kids' face'.\n",

Terms like \"blur\" (meaning oblivious or slow to understand) and \"kaypoh\" (overly inquisitive) are often used. As in your example, \"bludger\" could be translated as \"blur like sotong\", which means someone unable to comprehend or respond properly. Additionally, \"sneak his way out\" could be translated as \"smoke his way out.\" \n",

            "The term \"kutti\" is Tamil and denotes something small or little. In the context of Singaporean English, an equivalent term is \"small kaypoh\" where \"kaypoh\" is colloquial Singlish slang for gossip or news. The term \"our place\" is usually replaced with \"our flat\" or sometimes \"our house\". The ending \"can?\" is a common Singlish particle used to soften statements, making them sound more like a suggestion or a question, reflecting a polite tone.\n",
            "42 Everytime he sends a missed call, I think he never recharges his phone.\n",
            "Singaporean: Singaporeans use the term 'top up' instead of 'recharge' when referring to adding prepaid credits to a mobile phone. Additionally, they use 'call back' in place of 'missed call'. The phrase 'I think' can be replaced to 'I guess' which is a more colloquial term. \n",

            "Singaporean: In Singaporean English, or Singlish as it's known, terms such as \"lah\", \"ah\", and \"leh\" get used frequently. These are discourse particles that demonstrate the tone or emotional context of the phrase. The sentence's structure might become simpler and more straightforward, as Singlish tends to omit auxiliary verbs (\"is\", \"are\", \"the\"). In addition, \"like that only\" is commonplace to portray 'as it is.' So this sentence, 'These boys don't like to complete their homework, they always disobey teacher and laugh like that only,' could be translated to 'These boys don't like doing homework lah, always disobey teacher and laugh only like that one.'\n",

            "Singaporean: In Singaporean English, or \"Singlish,\" introductions are usually straightforward with less formal English phrases. 'Would be’ is a term commonly used in Indian English to refer to a fiance or fiancee, but in a Singaporean context, the term might not necessarily imply that level of relationship progression. It could simply indicate someone they intend to be with. A possible translation could be 'I want you to meet someone special'.\n",

The people in the back can't sit properly' can be translated into 'Can adjust the seat or not? The people at the back cannot sit properly leh.'

It incorporates local slangs, expressions and grammatical structures. 'Chumma don't act' is a common phrase used in Indian English, which essentially means 'Don't pretend'. 'We know you didn't buy' is a straightforward English sentence conveying the message that the speakers know the person did not purchase something.

            "Singaporean: In translating this sentence to Singaporean English, also commonly known as Singlish, we understand that \"popping around the corner\" often means to go somewhere nearby or accessible. As for \"biltong,\" although the term is not widely used in Singapore, we would retain it in the translation, as it refers to a specific South African dried, cured meat snack. Considering these points, the Singlish equivalent would then be: \"I just go nearby only buy some biltong.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In Singlish, the phrase \"go nearby only\" is used to reflect the action of going somewhere that is close by.

There is no direct Singaporean equivalent for \"braai\", as most Singaporeans simply use \"barbecue\" or colloquially \"BBQ\". The next part \"if the weather's good\" is less direct in Singaporean English, and is more often phrased as \"if the weather permits\" or \"if got good weather\". Thus, the Singaporean English equivalent would be \"I think we should BBQ this weekend if got good weather.\"\n",

'Hey' in standard English is used as 'lah' in Singlish for emphasis or seeking agreement. Therefore, the sentence 'That movie was too good, hey?' can be translated as 'That movie damn good leh!' in Singaporean English. 'Damn' here is used as an intensifier and 'good' refers to the quality of the movie. 'Leh' at the end of the sentence serves to soften the statement, making it less assertive and more friendly.\n",

            "Singaporean: In Singaporean English, commonly known as Singlish, certain words or phrases may be replaced with locally familiar terms or slang, and sometimes Malay or Chinese dialect words. The term 'skinny chap' could be referred to as 'skinny guy', 'in a de-mob suit' could be simplified to 'wearing a suit', 'knife' can retain its meaning, and 'kitbag' can be alternated to 'bag'. Incorporating local nuances, the translation could go like this: 'That skinny guy with a beard, dressed in a suit, and got that parang in his bag.' It's important to note that 'parang' is a Malay term commonly used in Singapore for a large, powerful knife or machete. It's a part of the local vernacular and is broadly understood.\n",
            "59 He fell off the stage at the Wigmore Hall and broke his leg, poor sod. So he offered me the holiday\n",
            "Singaporean: In Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, deference to figures of authority is common hence the direct reference to someone as 'poor sod' might be softened. Similarly, the phrase 'offered me the holiday' may be adjusted to fit more everyday Singlish conversational norms. \n",
            "\n",
            "Translation: \"Aiya, he go and fall down from the Wigmore Hall stage, break his leg somemore, sian. So, he just give me the holiday lor.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "Here, \"Aiya\" is a common interjection in Singlish for expressing frustration or annoyance. \"Go and\" is a colloquial way of suggesting an action was taken, often with a negative outcome. \"Somemore\" is used as emphasis in Singlish and retains its original meaning. \n",
            "\n",
            "The expression \"sian\" is commonly used in Singlish to express a feeling of boredom or frustration. Using \"just\" before an action is another common Singlish feature used to downplay the difficulty or complexity of an action. \"Give me the holiday\" is roughly translated to \"he just give me the holiday\". \"Lor\" has no specific meaning, but is a commonly used Singlish particle to indicate acceptance of a situation.\n",
            "60 Born and bred with a flat cap and a pint of mild and a job in steelworks\n",
            "Singaporean: Native Singaporeans blend English with other languages such as Malay, Tamil, and Chinese. Pronouns, as well as verb and noun endings, differ slightly in Singaporean English. They also often simplify and shorten phrases. The phrase 'Born and bred with a flat cap and a pint of mild and a job in steelworks' mainly relates to a person's upbringing and lifestyle, focused on a typical working-class individual. \n",
            "\n",
            "Translated into Singaporean English: 'Grow up also with cap and drink mild beer, then work at steel factory lor.' In this translation, 'lor' is frequently used in Singlish to denote a matter of fact or to suggest an inevitability. There's no equivalent in standard English but it's akin to saying 'that's the way it is.'\n"
