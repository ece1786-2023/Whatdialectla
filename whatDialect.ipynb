I\\'m in a hurry.\" - Indian English (Classified as 3) because \"Side, please\" is very common phrase used in Indian to ask the general public to move out the way in a polite manner. Indian english also end the sentences abruptly such with term such as that\\'s all, ok ya, this only no and so on.\\\n",
        "          \"Tim is a bludger; he always tries to sneak his way out of difficult situations.\" - Australian English (Classified as 4) because the word bludger is used to refer to a lazy person, its commonly used by australian\\'s.\\\n",
        "          \"It\\'s a bit chilling today, better than being hot though, isn\\'t it?\" - South African English (Classified as 5) because South Africans tend to use more double negatives to express themselves, most other dialects would have just use \"right?\" to end the sentence instead\\\n",
        "          \"We\\'re just having a bit of craic at the party.\" - Irish English (Classified as 6) because \"criac\" is Irish for having a good time and an irish accent tends to be more upbeat.\\\n",
        "          \"Our aim is to minimize the effort to train the two-stage pipeline of the conventional teacher-student framework.\" - General English, (Classified as 0) because there is no specific term or pattern suggesting that it belongs a particular dialect.\\\n",
