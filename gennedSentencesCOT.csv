0,"Sure, it's a grand day outside for a walk, isn't it?",Irs,"Eh, the weather outside quite good for jalan-jalan, right?

Reasoning: ""Eh"" is commonly used in Singaporean English (or Singlish) for calling attention. ""Quite good"" is a phrase often used by Singaporean to signify something is not just good, but quite satisfactory. ""Jalan-jalan"" is a Malay term used in Singlish meaning to ""go for a walk"".

1,I'll meet you down at the pub later for a pint.,Irs,"Later on I'll see you at the pub for a beer, okay? 

Singaporean English, often referred to colloquially as 'Singlish', is famed for its unique phrases and sentence structure. In this translation, ""I'll meet you down"" is made simpler to ""I'll see you"", as direct translations are more commonly used in Singlish. ""For a pint"" is translated to ""for a beer"" because 'a pint' is not as commonly used in Singaporean English. The term 'okay' is added at the end, mirroring the trend of ending statements with question tags in informal Singlish.",Singaporean
2,We're just having a bit of craic at the party.,Irs,"We're just having a bit of fun at the shindig. 

This might be how an Australian might phrase it. ""Craic"" is a term commonly in Ireland and the United Kingdom, much less frequently in Australian English. Instead, they might use ""fun"". Additionally, ""party"" could be replaced with a more colloquial term like ""shindig"".",Australian
3,I'm feeling a bit peckish; could you pass the Tayto crisps?,Irs,"I'm feeling a bit hungry; could you pass the chips, mate? 

Reasoning: In Australian English, ""peckish"" can be replaced with ""hungry"" for better understanding. ""Mate"" is commonly used in Australia as a form of address. In place of Ireland's ""Tayto crisps,"" Australians would typically say ""chips.""",Australian
4,Would you be after stopping at the shop for some milk?,Irs,"Can you pop by the store for some milk, buddy?

5,"That film was brilliant, so it was.",Irs,"Translated Sentence: That picture was first-rate, isn't it?

Reasoning: The word 'film' is often replaced with 'picture' in Indian English. 'So it was' could be replaced with 'isn't it' as a way to seek affirmation in a typical Indian manner. 'Brilliant' is directly translated to 'first-rate' to maintain the positive appreciation of the subject.",Indian
6,"I’ve a notion to bake some soda bread this afternoon, would you like some?",Irs,"I've a mind to bake some soda bread this afternoon, fancy some?

7,"It's a soft day, thank God, just a light drizzle.",Irs,"It's a mild day, thank God, just a light drizzle. 

In British English, especially among older generations, 'soft' in relation to weather often refers to gentle rain or drizzle. However, its usage is more common in Ireland than in the UK and could be regionally misunderstood. Therefore, the term 'mild' is adopted which is universally understood among British English speakers to mean temperate or not severe. The rest of the sentence remains the same as it is already in a form that would be understood by speakers of British English.",British
8,I'm just popping around the corner to buy some biltong.,Saf,"I'm just going nearby only to buy some biltong lah.

The sentence is translated to Singaporean English, commonly known as Singlish, a vernacular form of English spoken in Singapore.

Singlish also often omits the use of prepositions and auxiliary verbs for simplicity and speed in everyday communication.",Singaporean
9,"This new project is quite lekker, isn’t it?",Saf,"This new project quite shiok one, right?

Reasoning: 
In Singaporean English, or Singlish as it's colloquially known, the term ""shiok"" is used to express great pleasure or satisfaction. It's a term borrowed from Malay and is quite versatile. Here it's used to express the satisfaction about the new project, mirroring the meaning of ""lekker"" in the original sentence (a South African term for something enjoyable).

10,I reckon we should braai this weekend if the weather's good.,Saf,"Mate, reckon we should fire up the barbie this weekend if the weather's good, yeah?

The reasoning behind this Australian translation is because Australians commonly refer to their friends as 'mate'. They use 'reckon' instead of 'think', 'barbie' as an abbreviation for 'barbecue', and they often end their sentences with 'yeah' for confirmation. Furthermore, 'braai' is a term used in South Africa for a barbecue, so it's replaced with the Australian equivalent.",Australian
11,"I'll come visit you now-now, just finishing up some work.",Saf,"I'll pop by directly, just wrapping up some work. 

In Australian English, phrases such as 'come visit' may be replaced by more informal terms like 'pop by'.

It's also common in Australian English to use 'work' instead of 'some work'.",Australian
12,"That movie was too good, hey?",Saf,"That movie was first rate, isn't it?

15,"I’ll fix this now-now, won’t take more than a minute.",Saf,"I'll sort this out straight away, won't take more than a tick. 

""Now-now"" is a phrase commonly used in South African English meaning shortly or soon, this is not used in British English. The term ""fix"" can be replaced with ""sort out"" which is more common in British English. The phrase ""more than a minute"" can be swapped with ""more than a tick"" as ""tick"" is a somewhat informal British term for moment or instant.",British
16,We can go makan at the hawker centre later.,Sgp,"We can head over to the food court for some tucker later.

Reasoning: The phrase ""go makan"" in the original sentence is not English but Malay for ""go eat"". In Australian English, the common term for eating could simply be ""head over for some tucker"". ""Hawker centre"" is Singaporean English for a type of food court, so in Australian English, it is simply translated as ""food court"". Australians also tend to use the phrase ""head over"" instead of ""go"".",Australian
17,"You better study hard for the exam, if not later you regret.",Sgp,"You'd better hit the books hard for the test, mate, otherwise you'll be spewin' later. 

In Australia, ""study"" can be referred to in a casual context as ""hit the books"". The use of ""mate"" is an iconic Australian way of referring to friends and people in general. ""Spewin'"" is Australian slang, typically implying great disappointment, similar to 'regret'.",Australian
18,"Eh, you very kiasu leh, always must be first in everything.",Sgp,"Mate, you're a bit too competitive, always gotta be first in everything.

Reasoning: 'Eh' in Singapore English (Singlish) can be translated to 'Mate' in Australian English as it is often used informally to address someone. 'Kiasu' is a Singlish term meaning overly competitive or afraid to lose out, this concept can be translated to 'a bit too competitive.' Lastly, 'leh' is a Singlish discourse particle that does not have an equivalent in standard English, so it is omitted in the Aussie translation.",Australian
19,That ice cream was so shiok.,Sgp,"That ice cream was truly first-rate yaar. 

Reasoning: The term ""shiok"" which is commonly used in Singapore and Malaysia to denote delicious or relishing food. In Indian English, there's no direct equivalent, but phrases like ""first-rate"" or ""top-class"" can be used to express a similar sentiment. The term ""yaar"" is a common informal term used in Indian English to mean ""friend"" or ""mate"", similar to ""dude"" or ""bro"" in American English.",Indian
20,Have you finished your homework already or not?,Sgp,"Have you done with your homework or still doing it na?

Explanation: The word 'na' is commonly used at the end of sentences or questions in Indian English.

Also, the phrase 'done with' is more common than 'finished' when talking about completing tasks like homework.",Indian
21,"We need to submit this project by next week, can or not?",Sgp,"We have to give this project by next week, is it doable or not?

Reasoning: Indian English usually uses formal and more explicit verbiage. The term ""can or not?"" is more common in Singlish (Singapore English) or Manglish (Malaysian English). The phrase ""is it doable or not?"" or ""possible or not?"" is a more direct translation in Indian English. Also, the verb ""submit"" might be replaced by ""give"" in casual Indian English conversation.",Indian

In this translation, ""very sad"" has been replaced with the more British English phrase ""a real shame"". ""Age pool"" has been retained as is appropriate in British English too. The phrase ""for some reason, some people"" is translated as ""for some reason, some blokes"" as ""blokes"" is a British slang term for ""guys"" or ""men"". Lastly, ""have to go to"" is replaced by ""have to pop off to"" as ""pop off to"" is a colloquially British way to say ""go to"".",British
24,"She so garang, speaking up during meetings.",Sgp,"She's rather feisty, speaking up during meetings. 

""Garang"" is a dialect word from Singapore English (Singlish) and it suggests someone being fierce or aggressive. British English does not contain an exact term for this, but 'feisty' could be used as it refers to someone who is assertive and spirited.",British

Reasoning: In Singaporean English, also known as Singlish, the phrase ""a few screws loose upstairs"" is commonly used to describe someone with odd or eccentric behavior, signifying that the person isn't thinking clearly or is out of touch with reality. This is similar to the Australian slang “he’s a few roo's loose in the top paddock.” The word ""lah"" is a unique Singlish particle that often appears at the end of statements for emphasis or to soften a request or command. It doesn't have a specific English translation.",Singaporean
27,"I'm muzzed after that afterparty, it was a ripper of a party",Aus,"I'm damn shagged after that party, it was seriously solid one sia.

Reasoning: The use of ""damn"" in Singaporean English serves to emphasize or exaggerate a point, similar to how ""muzzed"" is used in the original sentence. ""Shagged"" is often used in Singaporean English to mean tired or exhausted. ""Solid"" is used to describe something that's impressive or good, substituting ""ripper"" from the original sentence. ""Sia"" is a Singlish particle for emphasis, often added at the end of sentences.",Singaporean

32,"nah yeah, lets get on this boat and have fun",Aus,"Right, let's hop on this boat and enjoy ourselves. 

In British English, especially in terms of its colloquial language, phrases such as ""nah yeah"" are actually quite uncommon. instead, simple affirmatives like ""right,"" or ""ok"" are commonly used to convey agreement or the intent to commence an activity. Furthermore, ""lets get on"" can simply be changed to ""let's hop on."" Brits may use the term ""have fun"" just as Americans do, but ""enjoy ourselves"" gives it a more British nuance.",British
33,"Tim is a bludger, he always tries to sneak his way out of difficult situations",Aus,"Tim is a skiver, he always tries to dodge his way out of sticky situations.

37,"These boys don't like to complete their homework, they always disobey teacher and laugh like that only, ",Ind,"These blokes don't enjoy doing their homework, they're always giving the teacher a hard time and just sit there having a laugh.

Reasoning: ""Boy"" in Australian English is often translated to ""bloke"". Australians also use the phrase ""giving a hard time"" to mean ""disobeying or causing trouble"".

As a dialectologist, it is important to retain the core meaning of the sentence while adapting it to the specific dialect.

Since there is no special Australian term or phrasing for 'would be', the sentence remains the same.",Australian
40,"I have a doubt, are you planning on going back home and then return, or come directly with us?",Ind,"Are you having a think about going home first and then coming back, or are you coming straight along with us?

In this British English translation, the American phrase 'having a doubt' is replaced with a more common British English phrase 'having a think' which makes more sense to a UK-based English speaker.

41,"Very rough fellow, doesn't know how to handle with care.",Ind,"Quite a rough bloke, doesn't know how to handle with care.

42,Kindly adjust the car seat. The people in the back can't sit properly,Ind,"Could you move your seat forward, mate? The folks in the back aren't able to sit right.

In British English, ""Kindly adjust"" can feel quite formal; using ""could you"" instead fits most conversational contexts better. We also use ""mate"" in a casual interaction with friends, which is equivalent to the American ""dude"". The term ""folks"" is used informally to refer to a group of people and is widely used in both American and British English. Finally, ""aren't able to sit right"" carries the same meaning as ""can't sit properly"" but seemed like a more informal, conversational choice suitable for this context.",British

In Singaporean English (also known as Singlish), ""No need"" is often used instead of ""You don't need"". ""One"" is a particle used for emphasis. ""Chope"" is a colloquial term for ""reserve"". ""Chio"" is a Singlish slang meaning attractive or good-looking and ""Teh"" is a term for tea. ""Punctual"" is a common way of referring to something that happens on time.

44,"She’s the second youngest in the house, after me of course, but the only other real adult apart from mum",Brt,"She one the second paiseh one in the house hor, after me lah but she the only other big people other than mum one leh.

Explanation:
In Singlish or Singaporean English, ""one"" is often used at the end of sentences for emphasis. ""Hor"" and ""lah"" are discourse particles commonly used in Singlish. ""Hor"" is mostly used in agreement or when seeking agreement in a gentle manner and ""lah"" is a well-known Singlish particle, often used for assertion. ""Paiseh"" is a term commonly used to denote 'shy' or 'embarrassed', but in this context it's used to refer to someone younger, in a playful way. ""Big people"" is a direct translation for adults, used colloquially in Singlish.",Singaporean
45,John They don’t know their arse from their elbow there. They don’t know sod all about music there,Brt,"Translation: ""Wah, they really blur like sotong there leh. They don't know zilch about music lor.""

Reasoning: In Singlish (Singaporean English), ""blur like sotong"" is a common phrase used to describe someone who is completely clueless, much like the English phrase ""don't know their arse from their elbow"". ""Wah"" is a common interjection used to express surprise or disbelief. ""Lor"" is frequently used at the end of sentences to stress a point or show resignation or acceptance, similar to ""there"" in the original sentence. ""Zilch"" is a slang term for ""nothing"" which is understood in most English dialects, including Singlish.",Singaporean

47,"Aye it's not nice. Lots of druggies, scroungers, you know",Brt,"'Mate, it's not flash. Tons of druggies, bludgers, you know.'

The term ""druggies"" stays the same as it is common language in both dialects. ""Scroungers"" changes to ""bludgers"" as this refers to a person who avoids work and sponges off others in Australian slang.",Australian
48,Without further ado I’ll let my darling wife Betty and my special daughter Emily do the revealing honours,Brt,"Without further ado, I'll let me beautiful wife Betty and me precious daughter Emily do the reveal. 

Explanation: ""Darling"" and ""special"" are replaced with ""beautiful"" and ""precious"" respectively as these are common terms of endearments used in Australia.

49,She’s also completely bonkers. Always seems to be worrying about what someone thinks,Brt,"She’s also absolutely batty. Forever stressing about what someone else may be thinking, isn't it?

Reasoning: In Indian English, 'batty' is commonly used to refer someone who is crazy or eccentric, similar to the use of 'bonkers' in American English.

50,"Skinny chap with a beard in a de-mob suit, and that knife up there in his kitbag",Brt,"Thin fellow with a beard in a retired soldier's attire, and that knife up there in his luggage mate.

Reasoning: ""Skinny chap"" translates to ""Thin fellow"" as 'fellow' is commonly used to refer to a man in Indian English. ""De-mob suit"" is a very British phrase. In Indian English, it could be translated to ""retired soldier's attire"" to make it more understandable, because the term ""de-mob"" generally refers to demobilization or discharge from a military service. Lastly, ""kitbag"" translates to ""luggage"" which is a more widespread term used in Indian English. ""Mate"" is often used colloquially and is similar in usage to 'pal' or 'dude'.",Indian
51,"He fell off the stage at the Wigmore Hall and broke his leg, poor sod. So he offered me the holiday",Brt,"He tumbled off the stage at Wigmore Hall and fractured his leg, poor chap. So, he handed me the holiday.

The term ""sod"" is largely associated with British dialects and is not very common in Indian English. It has been substituted with ""chap"", a term more frequently used in Indian English. ""He offered"" has been changed to ""he handed"", which suits Indian English better in this context.",Indian
